'''
The Gale-Shapley algorithm, also known as the Stable Marriage Problem, is a well-known algorithm used to find a stable matching between two equally sized sets of elements given an ordered preference for each element. A matching is considered "stable" if there are no two elements that would prefer each other over their current partners.


Initialize all men and women as free.
While there is a free man who still has a woman to propose to:
The man proposes to the most preferred woman to whom he has not yet proposed.
If the woman is free, she accepts the proposal (they become engaged).
If the woman is not free:
    She checks if she prefers this new proposal over her current engagement.
    If she prefers the new proposal, she replaces her current engagement with the new one, making her previous fianc√© free again.
    Otherwise, she rejects the new proposal, and the man remains free.
