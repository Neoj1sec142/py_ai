# The Machine Learning Landscape:
*[Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.—Arthur Samuel, 1959*
*A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.--Tom Mitchell, 1997*

- Applying ML techniques to dig into large amounts of data can help discover patterns that were not immediately apparent. This is called data mining.

To summarize, Machine Learning is great for:
* Problems for which existing solutions require 
    a lot of hand-tuning or long lists of rules: one Machine Learning algorithm can often simplify code and perform better.
* Complex problems for which there is no good 
    solution at all using a traditional approach: the best Machine Learning techniques can find a solution.
* Fluctuating environments: a Machine Learning 
    system can adapt to new data.
* Getting insights about complex problems and 
    large amounts of data.

### Types of Machine Learning Systems

There are so many different types of Machine Learning systems that it is useful to classify them in broad categories based on:
* Whether or not they are trained with human 
    supervision (supervised, unsuper‐ vised, semisupervised, and Reinforcement Learning)
* Whether or not they can learn incrementally 
    on the fly (online versus batch learning)
* Whether they work by simply comparing new 
    data points to known data points, or instead detect patterns in the training data and build a predictive model, much like scientists do (instance-based versus model-based learning)


##### Supervised/Unsupervised Learning:
- Machine Learning systems can be classified 
    according to the amount and type of supervision they get during training. There are four major categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semisupervised learning, and Reinforcement Learning.
- Supervised learning
    * In supervised learning, the training data 
        you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions

- It is often a good idea to try to reduce the dimension of your train‐ ing data using a dimensionality reduction algorithm before you feed it to another Machine Learning algorithm (such as a super‐ vised learning algorithm). It will run much faster, the data will take up less disk and memory space, and in some cases it may also per‐ form better.
